## Description

This Python script presents a simple yet functional Ticket Reservation System, allowing users to interact with a basic console-based interface for booking and managing seat reservations. The system features the following functionalities: 

1. Display Available Seats
Users can view the current availability of seats across different sections.

2. Book a Seat
Users can reserve a seat of their choice, with the system providing immediate feedback on the success or failure of the booking.

3. Cancel Booking
For users who need to alter their plans, the system enables the cancellation of a previously reserved seat, ensuring the seat becomes available for others.

4. View Reservation History
Users can review their reservation history, seeing a list of previously booked seats.

5. Exit
The program allows users to gracefully exit the Ticket Reservation System when they have completed their interactions.
